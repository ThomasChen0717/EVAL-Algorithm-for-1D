# This file contains polynomial coefficients and intervals for root finding.
# Each line represents a polynomial and its initial interval in the format:
# coeff1, coeff2, ..., coeffn, interval_start, interval_end
# coeff1 represents the leading coefficient(highest degree), and coeffn represents the constant
# For example:
# 1, -1, 0, -5, 5 represents x^2 - x + 0 in range [-5,5]
